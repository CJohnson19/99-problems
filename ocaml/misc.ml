(* Eight queens problem. (medium)
 *
 * This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective is to place
 *  eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other;
 *  i.e., no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or on the same
 *  diagonal.

 * Given a list of integer numbers, find a correct way of inserting arithmetic
